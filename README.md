# Word Count Program (C++)

This project is a simple C++ program that reads a text file (**wini.txt**) and counts how many times the word **"the"** or **"The"** appears.

## 📌 Features

* Reads text from a file
* Counts specific words
* Case-sensitive matching ("the" and "The")
* Simple and beginner‑friendly code
```

## 📂 How It Works

1. The program opens **wini.txt** using `ifstream`.
2. It reads each word one by one.
3. If the word matches **"the"** or **"The"**, the counter increases.
4. Finally, it prints the total count.

## 📁 Required File

Make sure the file **wini.txt** is in the same folder as your `.cpp` file.

Example content of *wini.txt*:

## ▶️ How to Run

### Using g++

g++ count.cpp -o count


./count
```

### Using CodeBlocks / Dev C++ / VS Code

* Open the file
* Build and run the program
